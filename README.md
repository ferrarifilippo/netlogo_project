# NetLogoProject (Intelligent drone swarm to extinguish fires)
 ![License](https://badgen.net/badge/license/GPL-3.0/red?icon=github)

<p>This work attempts to simulate a swarm of drones equipped with    fire detection sensors scouring a forested area for fires. 
Climate change is greatly increasing the risk of wildfires and also creating dangerous conditions for the spread of any arson fires, so it becomes imperative to develop new smart technologies suitable for fighting the phenomenon.</b></p>

### 
This project aims to implement the leader-follower structure for pattern formation presented in the paper [1]
Indeed, the drone that found the fire becomes the leader and is followed by the others in its actions to try to tame it. 
The following drones arrange themselves in a V-shaped pattern to improve aerodynamic efficiency and save energy.
